What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript, and how does its value differ in regular functions and arrow functions?
1. Purpose of this:
    This refers to the current object, used to access its properties and methods.
2. Regular functions vs Arrow functions:
    Regular functions: this refers to the object calling the function.
    Arrow functions: this inherits from the surrounding context, not the calling object.
