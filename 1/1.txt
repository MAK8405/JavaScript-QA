Theoretical:
Explain the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript. When should you use each one?
var: Old and function-scoped. Avoid using it due to hoisting and scope issues.
let: wBlock-scoped, allows reassignment. Use for variables that change.
const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned. Use for values that should remain constant.
